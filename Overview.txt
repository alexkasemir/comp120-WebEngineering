The Purrer API is a wonderful interface that allows developers to utilize the 
Purrer website in meaningful ways. This API allows for developers to create posts
and create users. It utilizes the Django REST framework. Developers have the option
to see all the posts that have been created and they also have the option to see all 
of the users that have been created. Obviously in later versions of this API, these
options will require authentication because we do not want everyone to have access to 
this information. 

The API allows for easy posting and user creation through the API. The step-by-step
guide goes into further depth about what headers are required and how to utilize 
each aspect of the API.

There are a few different API features. The POST feature, and the USER feature.

The POST API:

    WHAT IS IT?
    This API accept is a POST or a GET API. At the moment, a post can be created
    by any one. If posting a Post, the developer would simply create the post and send
    it through the API. The option to Get posts is also available. Someone could send a get request
    and they will be given all of the posts that have been written ever. A future addition
    to this API will be allowing someone to get all of the posts of a given user. This has not
    been created yet.

    WHY WOULD YOU USE IT?
    Developers would use this Post api if they wanted to have some service where
    they could automatically post posts to Purrer. Companies like to do this for
    promotional reasons. This Api could make these automatic posts easier than simply going
    onto the Purrer website everytime a promotion is wanted

    HOW?

    Creating a post(POST):
        ******LINK TO THIS*****
        http://localhost:8000/meows/api/posts/

        This could be done from the django-rest-framework by inputing a json object
        that looks like this:
            {"text_content": "Curl test"}
        This could also be done in testing by using the curl function call:
        curl -X POST -d @test.txt http://127.0.0.1:8000/meows/api/posts --header "Content-Type:application/json"
        where "test.txt" contains a json object to be posted like the one above

    Viewing a single Post(GET):
        A single post can be retrieved from this url (in json format):
            http://localhost:8000/meows/api/posts/5?format=json

        Or it can be retrieved using curl:
            curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/meows/api/posts/XX
            where XX is the pk of the post that is to be retrieved.


    Viewing all posts(GET):
        Going to this link will give you a json of all of the posts that have been 
        created.
        ****
        http://localhost:8000/meows/api/posts/?format=json
        ****

        or curl could be used as follows:
            curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/meows/api/posts
