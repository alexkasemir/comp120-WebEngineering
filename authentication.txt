AUTHENTICATION
______________

User posts in our web app are bound to specific users. So, in order
to create a post, a user must be authentic to our collection of users
(i.e. they must have a valid username and password). To edit a post, 
a user must be authenticated as the user who created the post. However, 
anyone may view any post, so authentication is not required to retrieve
the contents of a post. To sum, POSTs related to user posts need to be 
authenticated but GETs for posts do not. The one unique scenario is
deleting posts - authentication is of course required for this task,
but in addition to the creator of the post, someone with an admin 
account is able to delete posts. This allows for the removal of posts
inconsistant with the site's code of conduct or similar reasons.

The act of creating a user does not require authentication. However, 
retreiving some information about a user does require it; whether the
user is active, user email, and user password (hashed of course!) all 
require authentiaton. Username, icon url, and member since are freely
available. An authenticated admin also has the ability to view a dump
of all users and their information.
